### Manage translation strings in real time

- Let your non-developer team members finally manage translations (yes, even Karen from marketing).
- See those translations live in your app, so you can make sure “Submit” isn’t overlapping the button where “Do not press this button EVER” should be.
- Automatically create Pull Requests based on these changes, saving your developers from yet another “small tweak” email request.

> Let the world be translated, one typo at a time.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "moirai"
```

And then execute:
```bash
bundle
```

Next, you need to run the generator which will create the necessary files including the database migration, as well as inserting the engine in the `routes.rb` file:

```bash
bin/rails g moirai:install
```

Then run:

```bash
bin/rails db:migrate
```

## Usage

### How to change translations

If you mounted Moirai under "/moirai", head there and you will find a list of all the files containing texts that can be translated.
Open a file, change the value of translations, and press ENTER to update the translation and see it immediately changed on the application.

### Inline editing

By default, inline editing is disabled. To enable it, set the `moirai=true` query parameter in the URL.
If you want to only allow specific users to perform inline editing, you can override the `moirai_edit_enabled?` method in your application helper.

```ruby
module ApplicationHelper
  def moirai_edit_enabled?
    params[:moirai] == "true" || current_user&.admin?
  end
end
```

### Automatic PR creation with Octokit (**optional**)

If you would like Moirai to automatically create a pull request on GitHub to keep translations synchronized with the codebase, 
you need to set up [Octokit](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb).
Create a **Personal Access Token** on GitHub and configure the appropriate **environment variables**.

#### 1. Add Octokit to Your Gemfile

First, add Octokit to your project’s Gemfile:

```
gem 'octokit'
```

Then run `bundle install`.

#### 2. Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) on GitHub

You will need a Personal Access Token (PAT) with the `Content - Write` permission to create branches and pull requests.

-	Go to GitHub Token Settings.
-	Click Generate New Token.
-	Give your token a name (e.g., “Moirai”).
-	Under Scopes, select:
     -	repo (for full control of private repositories, including writing content).
     -	content (for read/write access to code, commit statuses, and pull requests).
-	Generate the token and copy it immediately as it will be shown only once.

#### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

You need to configure the following environment variables in your application:

-	`MOIRAI_GITHUB_REPO_NAME`: The name of the repository where the pull request will be created.
-	`MOIRAI_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN`: The Personal Access Token (PAT) you created earlier.

For example, in your `.env` file (or Rails credentials):

```env
MOIRAI_GITHUB_REPO_NAME=your-organization/your-repo
MOIRAI_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-generated-token
```

#### 4. Triggering the pull request creation

Moirai will now be able to use this Personal Access Token to create a pull request on GitHub when a translation is updated.

To trigger this, you can press the `Create Pull Request` button once you have made your changes.

### Authentication

Moirai allows you to use basic HTTP authentication to protect the engine. 
To enable this, you need to set the following environment variables:

```env
MOIRAI_BASICAUTH_NAME=moirai
MOIRAI_BASICAUTH_PASSWORD=moirai
```

> ⚠️ Remember to protect Moirai. You don't want to give everyone the possibility to change strings in the application.

If you have authenticated users, you can leverage the Rails Routes protection mechanism to protect the engine. 
See the following example:

```ruby
authenticated :user, lambda {|u| u.role == "admin"} do
  mount Moirai::Engine => '/moirai', as: 'moirai'
end
```

## Development

1. Check out the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:renuo/moirai.git
    cd moirai
    ```

2. Run the setup script to install dependencies:
    ```bash
    bin/setup
    ```

3. Copy the example environment variables file to create your own `.env` file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

4. Set your environment variables using the newly created `.env` file.

5. Run the tests:
    ```bash
    bin/check
    ```

6. To view the engine in a dummy app:
    ```bash
    bin/rails s
    ```
